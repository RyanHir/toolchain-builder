# This script is only to cleanup the sysroot and normalize
# and differences in the filesystem layout that exist between
# Debian and NI Linux. The goal is to have everyone follow a
# layout similar to NI Linux as it is easier to navigate.

# We do however modify the NI Linux layout to have libgcc_s
# in /usr/lib instead of /lib out of convenience.

# The Debian filesystem is better for multilib environments
# but this causes issues with a more vanilla version of
# binutils and GCC. So by using the NI Linux layout, we can
# avoid patching/hacking the build tools.
